Attributes overview (PHP8)

Attributes offer the ability to add structured, machine-readable metadata information on 
declarations in code: classes, methods, functions, parameters, properties and class constants 
can be the target of an attribute.

the metadata defined by attributes can then be inspected at runtime using the Reflection APIs.

Attributes could therefore be thought of as a configuration language embedded directly into code.

With attributes the generic implementation of a feature and its concrete use in an application
can be decoupled. in a way it is comparable to interfaces and their implementations. 
But where interfaces and implementations are about code, attributes are about annotating extra 
information and configuration.

interfaces can be implemented by classes, yet attributes can also be declared on methods, 
function, parameters, properties and class constants. As such they are more flexible than interfaces.
