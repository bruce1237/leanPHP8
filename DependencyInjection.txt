Dependency Injection(DI)
In software engineering, dependency injection is a technique in which an object receives other objects that it depends on, 
called dependencies. Typically, the receiving object is called a client and the passed-in ('injected') object is called a service.
The code that passes the service to the client is called the injector. Instead of the client specifying which service it will use,
the injector tells the client what service to use. 
the 'injection' refers to the passing of a dependency (a service) into the client that uses it.
